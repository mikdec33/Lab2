            <p>Welcome to my portfolio! Here I will showcase my projects and ideas that I think reflect my best work as a Software Engineer.</p>
            <p>I plan on including things like code snippets from past and current classes. As well as projects I have worked on outside of class. </p>
            <p>Please feel free to reach out to collaborate with me or if you have any questions, thank you!</p>

                <p>Given the size of their heads I think its no surprise that elephants are incredibly intelligent. But I still dont think we give them enough credit.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately the only measure for intelligence seems to be by comparison. Some things elephants can do that my cat cannot are:</p>
                <p>1. Recognize themselves in mirrors 2. Mourn their dead 3. Communicate through low-frequency rumbles that travel miles</p>
                <p>Their trunks alone contain over 40,000 muscles. They use it for everything like a hand. And of course the legends are true and elephant will remember</p>
                <p>Important things like the details of your face. In fact, here are some cool stories I found about elephant helping solve crimes.</p>

                <p>In conclusion, any creature that can learn to paint OR tattle tale on someone else is smart indeed.</p>
