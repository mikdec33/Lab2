        <p style="text-align: center;">Wikipedia is surely feeling betrayed since the dawn of the new age of ai. So I've asked it some questions, just this once, so it can feel like a valid source </p>

                <h3 style="text-align: center;">Mantis shrimp eyes?</h3>
                <p>Mantis shrimp possess some of the most complex eyes in the animal kingdom. Each eye operates independently, can detect polarized light, and up to 12 colors as opposed to humans who can only detect three</p>
                <p>Their eyes are divided into three parts, allowing them to perceive depth with just one eye. This helps them hunt with crazy precision since they can recognize the subtlest of changes in their environment.</p>
                <p>Nature is an engineer. Just as planes mimic birds scientists study mantis shrimp eyes seeking inspiration for new technologies in imaging and communication.</p>

                <h3 style="text-align: center;">Orion??</h3>
                <p>Look up! Orion is one of the most recognizable constellations in the night sky. Its belt of three bright stars has long served as a celestial landmark.</p>
                <p>Orionâ€™s shoulders and knees "Betelgeuse" and "Rigel" are also easy to spot. They are two of the brightest stars visible from Earth. In mythology, Orion was a giant huntsman placed among the stars by Zeus.</p>
                <p>The constellation is visible across both hemispheres and has inspired many stories.</p>
